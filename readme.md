My name is Mourtada Mbaye, and my resume's brand archetype was the Innocent. I had to create a pure, simple and moral aesthetic with my resume. My resume had to have a specific color scheme, needing soft pastel colors. My background photo was one of soft clouds, and a pastel blue color so the page would be easy on the eyes. The font I used was Lato, as I think that it fits the bill of being simple, clean and legible.
